# Recipe Management App

This is a Recipe Management App that allows you to create, store, and manage recipes. The app has been updated from a console application to a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience. With the GUI, you can easily add ingredients, create recipes, filter recipes based on criteria, and perform various operations on recipes.

## brief description (100 to 200 words) of what you changed based on your lecturerâ€™s 
feedback.



- Firstly, I implemented the ability to calculate and display the total calories of all the ingredients in a recipe. This feature allows users to get a quick overview of the nutritional value of their recipes. The `CalculateTotalCalories` method in the `Recipe` class calculates the sum of calories for each ingredient in the recipe, and the `DisplaySingleRecipe` method in the main program displays the total calories for a chosen recipe.

- Secondly, I added a notification feature that alerts the user when the total calories of a recipe exceed 300. This is important for individuals who are conscious of their calorie intake and want to stay within a certain limit. The notification is displayed when the total calories are calculated in the `CalculateTotalCalories` method and the result exceeds 300.
